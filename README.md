# Project Overview

In this project, I presented two JavaScript code examples, each demonstrating a different programming paradigm: imperative and declarative. My task was to analyse the examples and determine which one follows an imperative programming style and which one follows a declarative programming style.

I presented my reasoning for each example and recorded my presentation using Loom. I submitted my findings along with the Loom recording to the Project Tab on the Learning Management System (LMS).
